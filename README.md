Implementation of the [TodoMVC App Specification](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/blob/master/app-spec.md) using my [datival framework](https://github.com/mitchdzugan/datival)

Pretty happy with how this turned out. Despite writing datival for a completely separate purpose, was able to write this implemntation quickly and easily without needing to make any changes to datival core.

I don't have any specific metrics but clicking through a bunch of the example implementations at [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) my implementation was the shortest I found which is awesome as well since that again was not a direct goal of the project.
